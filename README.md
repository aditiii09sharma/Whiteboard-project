2. Add event listener in the `setupEventListeners()` method

    --primary-color: #3f51b5;    /* Main theme color */
    --secondary-color: #ff4081;  /* Accent color */
    --background-color: #f4f7f9; /* Page background */
    --canvas-bg: #ffffff;        /* Canvas background */
    --toolbar-bg: #2c3e50;      /* Toolbar background */
}
```
